# Remote-River-Energy-System-Flexible-Material-Pump-Design
This project redesigns a tidal turbine pump using flexible materials, inspired by fire bellows. It covers concept design, formal specification, option analysis, and detailed design. A strong candidate may also explore experimental prototyping. The repository includes design documentation, CAD models, and analysis.
